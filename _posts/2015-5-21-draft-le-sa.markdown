Update 2015-10-12: These documents are now out of date. Please visit our <a

up-to-date documents.

Today we're publishing the first public draft of the <a href="/documents/LE-SA-v1.0-June-23-2015.pdf">Let's Encrypt Subscriber Agreement</a>. We've attempted to create terms that are sensible for both our organization and our subscribers, and we want to give people a chance to review them before we start issuing certificates. Please <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/letsencrypt.org/forum/#!forum/ca-dev">let us know</a> if you have any questions or comments.
