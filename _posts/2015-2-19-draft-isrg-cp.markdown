Update 2015-10-12: These documents are now out of date. Please visit our <a
href="https://letsencrypt.org/repository/">Policy and Legal Repository</a> for
up-to-date documents.

Today we're publishing a <a href="/documents/ISRG-CP-May-5-2015.pdf">draft of our Certificate Policy (CP)</a>. This is an important document for any Certificate Authority (CA), and we want to give people a chance to review it before we start issuing certificates. Please <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/letsencrypt.org/forum/#!forum/ca-dev">let us know</a> if you have any questions or comments.

We're also working on our Certification Practice Statement (CPS), which describes how we're going to issue certificates under the policies outlined in our CP, but it isn't quite ready for public review yet. We're hoping to publish a draft within the next month.
