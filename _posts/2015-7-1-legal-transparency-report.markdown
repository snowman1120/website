The trust of our users is ISRG’s most critical asset. Transparency regarding legal requests is an important part of making sure our users can trust us, and to that end we will be publishing reports twice annually. With the exception of this first report, reports will be published three months after the period covered in order to allow us time to research all requests and orders received during the period.
