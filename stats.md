## Code
Since the [2017-07-03 methodology change](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/adjustments-to-the-lets-encrypt-statistics-methodology/):
- [ct-mapreduce](https://github.com/jcjones/ct-mapreduce) ingests data from CT logs and Firefox Telemetry, and produces statistics about Let's Encrypt.

Before 2017-07-03:
- [ct-sql](https://github.com/jcjones/ct-sql) ingests data from Censys.io, CT logs, and Firefox Telemetry.
- [ct-sql-queries](https://github.com/jcjones/ct-sql-queries) contains the SQL queries run periodically to construct the data.
